# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Agent Competition System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items passed on first review. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

### Validation Details:

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS
- Spec focuses on WHAT users need (task submission, evaluation, leaderboard viewing) rather than HOW to implement
- No mention of Pydantic AI or NiceGUI in the specification (tech stack excluded as required)
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Quality Gates) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are specific and clear
- Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-001: can verify users can submit prompts, FR-007: can verify leaderboard sorts correctly)
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (30 seconds, 100%, 2-5 agents, 0-100 scores)
- Success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes, not technical internals
- All user stories have acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format
- Edge cases section identifies 6 boundary conditions and error scenarios
- Scope is bounded: 2-5 agents, 3 specific tools, evaluation range 0-100
- No external dependencies assumed

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS
- Each of 11 functional requirements maps to user stories and acceptance scenarios
- User stories cover the complete flow: task submission → parallel execution → evaluation → leaderboard display → history exploration
- Success criteria SC-001 through SC-006 align with user stories and provide measurable validation targets
- Specification maintains abstraction - no code, database schemas, API endpoints, or framework details

**Recommendation**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.
